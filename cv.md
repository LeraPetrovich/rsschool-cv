#### Briefly About Myself:

Hello, my name is Valeria, At the moment I am a 2nd year student of the Faculty of Radiophysics and Computer Technology of BSU. In my first year I studied the basics of C++. After studying C++, I became interested in web development. I studied basic JavaScript skills with rsshool. I am a punctual and responsible person. I always do the right job on time. I quickly find a common language with the team and have intermediate interpersonal communication skills. I like to occupy my time with self-development. Working in a remote format will give me the opportunity to do the right job regardless of the place and time.
